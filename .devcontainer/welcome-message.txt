👋  Welcome to Flask in Codespaces!

🛠️  Your environment is setup with all the required dependencies and your fork has been added as a remote.

🚀  To start coding:
    - wait for the "postCreateCommand" to finish setting things up
    - run `git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/{main-or-latest-release}` to start working on a new feature or bug fix.
