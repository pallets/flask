# Flask

Flask is a lightweight [WSGI] web application framework. It is designed
to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around [Werkzeug]
and [Jinja], and has grown into one of the most popular Python web
frameworks in the world.

Flask provides a minimal core with no enforced project layout, allowing
developers to choose the tools and libraries they prefer. Its flexibility
makes it an excellent choice for both small projects and enterprise-grade
applications.

## Why Flask?

- Minimal by design â€“ no rigid structure, full freedom of choice.
- Scalable from small scripts to large applications.
- Extensible through a rich ecosystem of extensions.
- Backed by strong documentation and a large, active community.

## A Simple Example

```python
# save this as app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

```
$ flask run
