The Request Context
===================

The request context keeps track of the request-level data during a
request. Rather than passing the request object to each function that
runs during a request, the :data:`request` and :data:`session` proxies
are accessed instead.

This is similar to :doc:`/appcontext`, which keeps track of the
application-level data independent of a request. A corresponding
application context is pushed when a request context is pushed.


Purpose of the Context
----------------------

When the :class:`Flask` application handles a request, it creates a
:class:`Request` object based on the environment it received from the
WSGI server. Because a *worker* (thread, process, or coroutine depending
on the server) handles only one request at a time, the request data can
be considered global to that worker during that request. Flask uses the
term *context local* for this.

Flask automatically *pushes* a request context when handling a request.
View functions, error handlers, and other functions that run during a
request will have access to the :data:`request` proxy, which points to
the request object for the current request.


Lifetime of the Context
-----------------------

When a Flask application begins handling a request, it pushes a request
context, which also pushes an :doc:`app context </appcontext>`. When the
request ends it pops the request context then the application context.

The context is unique to each thread (or other worker type).
:data:`request` cannot be passed to another thread, the other thread has
a different context space and will not know about the request the parent
thread was pointing to.

Context locals are implemented using Python's :mod:`contextvars` and
Werkzeug's :class:`~werkzeug.local.LocalProxy`. Python manages the
lifetime of context vars automatically, and local proxy wraps that
low-level interface to make the data easier to work with.


Manually Push a Context
-----------------------

If you try to access :data:`request`, or anything that uses it, outside
a request context, you'll get this error message:

.. code-block:: pytb

    RuntimeError: Working outside of request context.

    This typically means that you attempted to use functionality that
    needed an active HTTP request. Consult the documentation on testing
    for information about how to avoid this problem.

This should typically only happen when testing code that expects an
active request. One option is to use the
:meth:`test client <Flask.test_client>` to simulate a full request. Or
you can use :meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` in a ``with`` block, and
everything that runs in the block will have access to :data:`request`,
populated with your test data. ::

    def generate_report(year):
        format = request.args.get("format")
        ...

    with app.test_request_context(
        "/make_report/2017", query_string={"format": "short"}
    ):
        generate_report()

If you see that error somewhere else in your code not related to
testing, it most likely indicates that you should move that code into a
view function.

For information on how to use the request context from the interactive
Python shell, see :doc:`/shell`.


How the Context Works
---------------------

The :meth:`Flask.wsgi_app` method is called to handle each request. It
manages the contexts during the request. Internally, the request and
application contexts work like stacks. When contexts are pushed, the
proxies that depend on them are available and point at information from
the top item.

When the request starts, a :class:`~ctx.RequestContext` is created and
pushed, which creates and pushes an :class:`~ctx.AppContext` first if
a context for that application is not already the top context. While
these contexts are pushed, the :data:`current_app`, :data:`g`,
:data:`request`, and :data:`session` proxies are available to the
original thread handling the request.

Other contexts may be pushed to change the proxies during a request.
While this is not a common pattern, it can be used in advanced
applications to, for example, do internal redirects or chain different
applications together.

After the request is dispatched and a response is generated and sent,
the request context is popped, which then pops the application context.
Immediately before they are popped, the :meth:`~Flask.teardown_request`
and :meth:`~Flask.teardown_appcontext` functions are executed. These
execute even if an unhandled exception occurred during dispatch.


.. _callbacks-and-errors:

Callbacks and Errors
--------------------

Flask dispatches a request in multiple stages which can affect the
request, response, and how errors are handled. The contexts are active
during all of these stages.

A :class:`Blueprint` can add handlers for these events that are specific
to the blueprint. The handlers for a blueprint will run if the blueprint
owns the route that matches the request.

#.  Before each request, :meth:`~Flask.before_request` functions are
    called. If one of these functions return a value, the other
    functions are skipped. The return value is treated as the response
    and the view function is not called.

#.  If the :meth:`~Flask.before_request` functions did not return a
    response, the view function for the matched route is called and
    returns a response.

#.  The return value of the view is converted into an actual response
    object and passed to the :meth:`~Flask.after_request`
    functions. Each function returns a modified or new response object.

#.  After the response is returned, the contexts are popped, which calls
    the :meth:`~Flask.teardown_request` and
    :meth:`~Flask.teardown_appcontext` functions. These functions are
    called even if an unhandled exception was raised at any point above.

If an exception is raised before the teardown functions, Flask tries to
match it with an :meth:`~Flask.errorhandler` function to handle the
exception and return a response. If no error handler is found, or the
handler itself raises an exception, Flask returns a generic
``500 Internal Server Error`` response. The teardown functions are still
called, and are passed the exception object.

If debug mode is enabled, unhandled exceptions are not converted to a
``500`` response and instead are propagated to the WSGI server. This
allows the development server to present the interactive debugger with
the traceback.


Teardown Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The teardown callbacks are independent of the request dispatch, and are
instead called by the contexts when they are popped. The functions are
called even if there is an unhandled exception during dispatch, and for
manually pushed contexts. This means there is no guarantee that any
other parts of the request dispatch have run first. Be sure to write
these functions in a way that does not depend on other callbacks and
will not fail.

During testing, it can be useful to defer popping the contexts after the
request ends, so that their data can be accessed in the test function.
Use the :meth:`~Flask.test_client` as a ``with`` block to preserve the
contexts until the ``with`` block exits.

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask, request

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        print('during view')
        return 'Hello, World!'

    @app.teardown_request
    def show_teardown(exception):
        print('after with block')

    with app.test_request_context():
        print('during with block')

    # teardown functions are called after the context with block exits

    with app.test_client() as client:
        client.get('/')
        # the contexts are not popped even though the request ended
        print(request.path)

    # the contexts are popped and teardown functions are called after
    # the client with block exits

Signals
~~~~~~~

The following signals are sent:

#.  :data:`request_started` is sent before the :meth:`~Flask.before_request` functions
    are called.
#.  :data:`request_finished` is sent after the :meth:`~Flask.after_request` functions
    are called.
#.  :data:`got_request_exception` is sent when an exception begins to be handled, but
    before an :meth:`~Flask.errorhandler` is looked up or called.
#.  :data:`request_tearing_down` is sent after the :meth:`~Flask.teardown_request`
    functions are called.


.. _notes-on-proxies:

Notes On Proxies
----------------

Some of the objects provided by Flask are proxies to other objects. The
proxies are accessed in the same way for each worker thread, but
point to the unique object bound to each worker behind the scenes as
described on this page.

Most of the time you don't have to care about that, but there are some
exceptions where it is good to know that this object is actually a proxy:

-   The proxy objects cannot fake their type as the actual object types.
    If you want to perform instance checks, you have to do that on the
    object being proxied.
-   The reference to the proxied object is needed in some situations,
    such as sending :doc:`signals` or passing data to a background
    thread.

If you need to access the underlying object that is proxied, use the
:meth:`~werkzeug.local.LocalProxy._get_current_object` method::

    app = current_app._get_current_object()
    my_signal.send(app)
