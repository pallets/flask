Welcome to Flask's documentation. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications.

Get started with :doc:`installation`
and then get an overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a
more detailed :doc:`tutorial/index` that shows how to create a small but
complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the
:doc:`patterns/index` section. The rest of the docs describe each
component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the :doc:`api`
section.

Flask depends on the `Werkzeug`_ WSGI toolkit, the `Jinja`_ template engine, and the
`Click`_ CLI toolkit. Be sure to check their documentation as well as Flask's when
looking for information.

User's Guide
------------

Flask provides configuration and conventions, with sensible defaults, to get started.
This section of the documentation explains the different parts of the Flask framework
and how they can be used, customized, and extended. Beyond Flask itself, look for
community-maintained extensions to add even more functionality.
