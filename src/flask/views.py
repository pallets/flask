class View:
    """Alternative way to use view functions.  A subclass has to implement
    :meth:`dispatch_request` which is called with the view arguments from
    the URL routing system.  If :attr:`methods` is provided the methods
    do not have to be passed to the :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule`
    method explicitly::

        class MyView(View):
            methods = ['GET']

    When you want to decorate a pluggable view you will have to either do that
    when the view function is created (by wrapping the return value of
    :meth:`as_view`) or you can use the :attr:`decorators` attribute::

        class SecretView(View):
            methods = ['GET']
            decorators = [superuser_required]

            def dispatch_request(self):
                ...

    The decorators stored in the decorators list are applied one after another
    when the view function is created.  Note that you can *not* use the class
    based decorators since those would decorate the view class and not the
    generated view function!
