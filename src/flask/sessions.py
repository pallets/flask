    """The basic interface you have to implement in order to replace
    the default session interface. The only methods you have to
    implement are :meth:`open_session` and :meth:`save_session`, the
    others have useful defaults which you don't need to change.

    The session object returned by the :meth:`open_session` method has to
    provide a dictionary like interface plus the properties and methods
    from the :class:`SessionMixin`.  We recommend just subclassing a dict
    and adding that mixin::

        class Session(dict, SessionMixin):
            pass

    If :meth:`open_session` returns ``None`` Flask will call into
    :meth:`make_null_session` to create a session that acts as replacement
    if the session support cannot work because some requirement is not
    fulfilled.  The default :class:`NullSession` class that is created
    will complain that the secret key was not set.

    To replace the session interface on an application all you have to do
    is to assign :attr:`flask.Flask.session_interface`::

        app = Flask(__name__)
        app.session_interface = MySessionInterface()

    Multiple requests with the same session may be sent and handled
    concurrently. When implementing a new session interface, consider
    whether reads or writes to the backing store must be synchronized.
    There is no guarantee on the order in which the session for each
    request is opened or saved, it will occur in the order that requests
    begin and end processing.

        modifications are answered with a helpful error message of what
