class Flask(_PackageBoundObject):
    """The flask object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central
    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    an `__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a `.py` file).

    For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.

    Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or
    in the `__init__.py` file of your package like this::

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

    .. admonition:: About the First Parameter

        The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea what
        belongs to your application.  This name is used to find resources
        on the file system, can be used by extensions to improve debugging
        information and a lot more.

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are
        using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of
        your package there.

        For example if your application is defined in `yourapplication/app.py`
        you should create it with one of the two versions below::

            app = Flask('yourapplication')
            app = Flask(__name__.split('.')[0])

        Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks
        to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more
        painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the
        import name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy
        extension will look for the code in your application that triggered
        an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set
        up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only
        pick up SQL queries in `yourapplicaiton.app` and not
        `yourapplication.views.frontend`)

    .. versionadded:: 0.5
       The `static_path` parameter was added.

    :param import_name: the name of the application package

                        static files on the web.  Defaults to ``/static``.

            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                return 'Hello World'

        Variables parts in the route can be specified with angular
        brackets (``/user/<username>``).  By default a variable part
        in the URL accepts any string without a slash however a different
        converter can be specified as well by using ``<converter:name>``.

        Variable parts are passed to the view function as keyword
        arguments.

        The following converters are possible:

        =========== ===========================================
        `int`       accepts integers
        `float`     like `int` but for floating point values
        `path`      like the default but also accepts slashes
        =========== ===========================================

        Here some examples::

            @app.route('/')
            def index():
                pass

            @app.route('/<username>')
            def show_user(username):
                pass

            @app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')
            def show_post(post_id):
                pass

        An important detail to keep in mind is how Flask deals with trailing
        slashes.  The idea is to keep each URL unique so the following rules
        apply:

        1. If a rule ends with a slash and is requested without a slash
           by the user, the user is automatically redirected to the same
           page with a trailing slash attached.
        2. If a rule does not end with a trailing slash and the user request
           the page with a trailing slash, a 404 not found is raised.

        This is consistent with how web servers deal with static files.  This
        also makes it possible to use relative link targets safely.

        The :meth:`route` decorator accepts a couple of other arguments
        as well:

        :param rule: the URL rule as string
        :param methods: a list of methods this rule should be limited
                        to (`GET`, `POST` etc.).  By default a rule
                        just listens for `GET` (and implicitly `HEAD`).
                        Starting with Flask 0.6, `OPTIONS` is implicitly
                        added and handled by the standard request handling.
        :param subdomain: specifies the rule for the subdomain in case
                          subdomain matching is in use.
        :param strict_slashes: can be used to disable the strict slashes
                               setting for this rule.  See above.
        :param options: other options to be forwarded to the underlying
