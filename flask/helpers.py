    views do not have to return response objects but can return a value that
    is converted into a response object by Flask itself, it becomes tricky to
    add headers to it.  This function can be called instead of using a return
    and you will get a response object which you can use to attach headers.

    If view looked like this and you want to add a new header::

        def index():
            return render_template('index.html', foo=42)

    You can now do something like this::

        def index():

            response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    This function accepts the very same arguments you can return from a
    view function.  This for example creates a response with a 404 error
    code::

        response = make_response(render_template('not_found.html'), 404)

    The other use case of this function is to force the return value of a
    view function into a response which is helpful with view
    decorators::

        response = make_response(view_function())
        response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    -   if no arguments are passed, it creates a new response argument
    -   if one argument is passed, :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response`
        is invoked with it.
    -   if more than one argument is passed, the arguments are passed
        to the :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response` function as tuple.

def url_for(endpoint, **values):
    """Generates a URL to the given endpoint with the method provided.

    Variable arguments that are unknown to the target endpoint are appended
    to the generated URL as query arguments.  If the value of a query argument
    is `None`, the whole pair is skipped.  In case blueprints are active
    you can shortcut references to the same blueprint by prefixing the
    local endpoint with a dot (``.``).

    This will reference the index function local to the current blueprint::

        url_for('.index')

    For more information, head over to the :ref:`Quickstart <url-building>`.

    To integrate applications, :class:`Flask` has a hook to intercept URL build
    errors through :attr:`Flask.build_error_handler`.  The `url_for` function
    results in a :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` when the current app does
    not have a URL for the given endpoint and values.  When it does, the
    :data:`~flask.current_app` calls its :attr:`~Flask.build_error_handler` if
    it is not `None`, which can return a string to use as the result of
    `url_for` (instead of `url_for`'s default to raise the
    :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` exception) or re-raise the exception.
    An example::

        def external_url_handler(error, endpoint, **values):
            "Looks up an external URL when `url_for` cannot build a URL."
            # This is an example of hooking the build_error_handler.
            # Here, lookup_url is some utility function you've built
            # which looks up the endpoint in some external URL registry.
            url = lookup_url(endpoint, **values)
            if url is None:
                # External lookup did not have a URL.
                # Re-raise the BuildError, in context of original traceback.
                exc_type, exc_value, tb = sys.exc_info()
                if exc_value is error:
                    raise exc_type, exc_value, tb
                else:
                    raise error
            # url_for will use this result, instead of raising BuildError.
            return url

        app.build_error_handler = external_url_handler

    Here, `error` is the instance of :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError`, and
    `endpoint` and `**values` are the arguments passed into `url_for`.  Note
    that this is for building URLs outside the current application, and not for
    handling 404 NotFound errors.
