    :meth:`dispatch_request` which is called with the view arguments from
    the URL routing system.  If :attr:`methods` is provided the methods
    do not have to be passed to the :meth:`~flask.Flask.add_url_rule`
    method explicitly::

    :meth:`as_view`) or you can use the :attr:`decorators` attribute::

    based decorators since those would decorate the view class and not the
    generated view function!
