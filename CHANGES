Flask Changelog
===============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Flask release.

Version 0.4
-----------

Released on June 18th 2010, codename Rakia

- added the ability to register application wide error handlers
  from modules.
- :meth:`~flask.Flask.after_request` handlers are now also invoked
  if the request dies with an exception and an error handling page
  kicks in.
- test client has not the ability to preserve the request context
  for a little longer.  This can also be used to trigger custom
  requests that do not pop the request stack for testing.
- because the Python standard library caches loggers, the name of
  the logger is configurable now to better support unittests.
- added `TESTING` switch that can activate unittesting helpers.
- the logger switches to `DEBUG` mode now if debug is enabled.

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Bugfix release, released May 28th 2010

- fixed a error reporting bug with :meth:`flask.Config.from_envvar`

  folder for themes, built documentation in zip and pdf file and
  some .pyc files)

Version 0.3
-----------

Released on May 28th 2010, codename Schnaps

- added support for categories for flashed messages.
- the application now configures a :class:`logging.Handler` and will

  mode.  This makes it possible to receive mails on server errors
  for example.
- added support for context binding that does not require the use of
  the with statement for playing in the console.

  it possible to further push the request context or pop it.
